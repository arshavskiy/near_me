        "extract": "The sack of 455 was the third of four ancient sacks of Rome; it was conducted by the Vandals, who were then at war with the usurping Western Roman Emperor Petronius Maximus.\n\n\n Background \nIn the 440s, the Vandal king Genseric and the Roman Emperor Valentinian III had betrothed their children, Huneric and Eudocia, to strengthen their alliance, reached in 442 with a peace treaty (the marriage was delayed as Eudocia was too young). In 455 Valentinian was killed, and Petronius Maximus rose to the throne. Petronius married Valentinian's widow, Licinia Eudoxia, and had his son Palladius marry Eudocia; in this way Petronius was to strengthen his bond with the Theodosian dynasty. Unhappy, however, with her husband's murder and the usurpation of Maximus, Eudoxia turned to aid from the Vandals to remove Maximus from his undeserved throne. The overture was favorably met, because Maximus' revolution was damaging to Genseric's ambitions. The king of the Vandals claimed that the broken betrothal between Huneric and Eudocia invalidated his peace treaty with Valentinian, and set sail to attack Rome, landing at Ostia at the mouth of the Tiber.\n\n\n The sack \nBefore approaching the city, the Vandals knocked down all of the city's aqueducts. At the sight of the approaching Vandals, Maximus and his soldiers tried to flee the city but he was spotted and killed by a Roman mob outside the city, possibly together with his son Palladius. Upon the Vandal arrival, according to the chronicler Prosper of Aquitaine, Pope Leo I requested that Genseric not destroy the ancient city nor murder its inhabitants. Genseric agreed and the gates of Rome were thrown open to him and his men.\nWhile Genseric kept his promise not to burn the city and slaughter its inhabitants, he did carry off some to be slaves, and during that time Genseric managed to capture Empress Licinia Eudoxia, Valentinian's widow, and her daughters, Eudocia and Placidia as they tried to escape. Eudoxia and her children were the last of Rome's imperial family. Eudocia would later marry Huneric.\n\n\n Aftermath \nIt is accepted that Genseric looted great amounts of treasure from the city, damaging objects of cultural significance such as the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus by stripping away the gilt bronze roof tiles.  There is, however, some debate over the severity of the Vandal sack. The sack of 455 is generally seen as being more thorough than the Visigothic sack of 410 because the Vandals plundered Rome for fourteen days whereas the Visigoths spent only three days in the city.\n\n\n Interpretation \nA cause of significant controversy is the claim that the sack was relatively \"clean\", in that there was little murder and violence, and the Vandals did not burn the buildings of the city. This interpretation seems to stem from Prosper's claim that Pope Leo I managed to persuade Genseric to refrain from violence. However, Victor of Vita records that a number of shiploads of captives arrived in Africa from Rome, with the purpose of being sold into slavery. Similarly, the Byzantine historian Procopius reports that a church was burned down. Some modern historians like John Henry Haaren stated that temples, public buildings, private houses and even the emperor's palace were sacked. Besides taking many Romans as slaves, the Vandals also committed other depredations like taking immense quantities of gold, silver, jewels and furniture, destroying works of art, and killing a number of citizens.\n\n\n See also \nSack of Constantinople\n\n\n Notes \n\n\n References \n\n\n Citations \n\n\n Sources \nProcopius, 'The Vandalic War' in The History of the Wars, Books III & IV, trans.

        "extract": "Cathedral Square or Sobornaya Square (Russian: Соборная площадь, or Sobornaya ploshchad) is the central square of the Moscow Kremlin where all of its streets used to converge in the 15th century.The square owes its name to the three cathedrals facing it – Cathedral of the Dormition, Cathedral of the Archangel, and Cathedral of the Annunciation. Apart from these, the Palace of Facets, the Church of the Deposition of the Robe and the Church of the Twelve Apostles are placed there. The tallest structure on the square (and formerly in all of Russia) is Ivan the Great Bell Tower, which also separates Sobornaya Square from Ivanovskaya Square.\nCathedral Square is famous as the site of solemn coronation and funeral processions of all the Russian tsars, patriarchs, and Grand Dukes of Moscow. Even today, the square is used in the inauguration ceremony of the President of Russia.The square is also the scene of the daily changing of the Horse Guards (a spectacular imperial tradition restored in the 21st century).\n\n\n References ",

        "extract": "Nabokov House is a house in Saint Petersburg with the modern street number of 47 Great Morskaya Street (Bol'shaia morskaia ulitsa), 190000. In 1897, the mansion became the property of the liberal statesman and jurist Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov, and as such the house hosted many important political meetings, including the final session of the National Congress of Zemstvos (1904).\nIt was also in this mansion that novelist Vladimir Nabokov was born in 1899. Currently, the first floor of the house contains the Nabokov Museum, dedicated to the author's life.\n\n\n History of the house \n\nIt is a medium to large townhouse that was built during the 19th century in the Neo-Renaissance style for the Polovtsev family.\nBetween 1897 and the October Revolution, the house was the property of the liberal statesman and jurist Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov, who had obtained it as a dowry of Elena Rukavishnikova. As such, it became host to many political meetings, particularly in the lead up and following the first Russian Revolution of 1905. It was in this house that the final session of the National Congress of Zemstvos was hosted in 1904.\nThe house is also notable for being the home of Vladimir Vladimirovich, who lived in the house until November 1917. The house is meticulously described in his autobiography The Other Shores and Speak, Memory. For Vladimir, the house remained the only house in the world. Subsequently, even when he grew rich, he never acquired any other house and preferred to live in hotels.\nA close childhood friend of Olga Nabokova was Ayn Rand (Alisa Rosenbaum). As children, the two would engage in endless political debates in this house; while Nabokova defended constitutional monarchy, Rand supported republican ideals.The house was broken into by Bolshevik revolutionaries during the October Revolution (1917).\n\n\n Nabokov Museum \nSince April 1998, the first floor of the house (the family floor in Nabokov's time) is occupied by the Nabokov Museum and the upper two stories (the parents' floor and the children's floor) are occupied by the offices of the newspaper Nevskoe Vremya. In the museum space are the Phone room, Dining room, Library, Committee Room (where most of the meetings of the Constitutional Democratic party were held) and the Kitchen.\n\nVery little has remained from the Nabokov family’s life in the house. Time and history spared nothing except the interiors of several rooms on the first and second floors of the building and the old stained-glass window above the flight of stairs leading to the third floor.\nNabokov memorabilia, including Vladimir Nabokov's personal effects (index cards, pencils, eyeglasses, scrabble game), as well as books and other objects connected to his life and art, form the core of the museum's collection. The museum is dedicated to fostering Nabokov's memory and his artistic legacy and cultural values, both within Russia and internationally. The museum houses exhibits related to Nabokov's life and milieu and provides a research library for Nabokov scholars, and also holds many events and activities inspired by Nabokov: readings of works by Nabokov and those he admired, (such as Chekhov and Joyce), lectures, international or single-nation conferences (\"Nabokov and Russia,\" \"Nabokov and England,\" \"Nabokov and France,\" \"Nabokov and Germany,\" \"Nabokov and the United States\"), an annual international Nabokov summer school, and exhibitions and installations related to Nabokov. Its activities have the regular support of leading Nabokov scholars from around the world.\n\n\n Vandalism \nA series of threatening letters were sent to the museum, threatening staff whether 'they are afraid of the wrath of God for the promotion of the pedophile Nabokov'.\nOn the night of January 10, 2013, unknown vandals broke the windows of the Museum, throwing into the house a bottle with a note containing threats and insults. A few days later, Artyom Suslov, the organizer of the play 'Lolita', was also severely beaten up in Saint Petersburg, with a video released on the internet of the beating, in which Suslov was made to confess to promoting pedophilia.\nOn the night of 29 January 2013, vandals defaced the  wall of the Museum with the word \"pedophile\".  Law enforcement authorities later initiated a criminal case under Art. 214 of the Russian Criminal Code to investigate the defacement of the museum.\nOn the 20 February 2013, vandals attacked the Nabokov Rozhdestveno Memorial Estate \n\n\n Museum info \n190000, St.Petersburg # 47 Bol'shaya MorskayaThe museum is open daily from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., Saturday and Sunday from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m., and closed Monday.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n References \n\nBooklet Saint Petersburg Museum of V.
